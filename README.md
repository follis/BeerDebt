The Rules of Beer Debt

## Introduction
Suppose somebody does you a favor.  You thank them and say, "Hey, I owe you a beer."
Seems simple enough.  But like everything else, it isn't.
What are the rules?  This is an attempt to document them.

## Scope and Terminology

These rules apply when purchase of a future beer is indicated in response to some action on the part of the debtee.  For example, if I do you a favor and you say you owe me a beer, then you are the beer debtor and I am the beer debtee.  These rules do not apply when beers are being purchased in real time in exchange for the purchase of other beers in the immediate future (e.g. "buying a round").  Beers purchased in that context can not be applied to beer debt.  

## Beer Debt is Reflexive.  

A beer is a beer.  There are no adjustments or conversions made between a beer debt being paid with one type of beer over another.  Exceptionally crappy beers may be judged by the debtee to be insufficient payment.  Both participants may choose to define exceptionally large beers (i.e. 1 Liter or more) as more than one beer.  But generally a beer is a beer.

## Beer Debt is not Symmetric.  

If I owe you a beer and you owe me a beer, the debts are not cancelled out.  This results in a net loss of beer which is always bad.  

## Beer Debt is not Transitive.  

If Fred owes Bob a beer and Bob owes Ian a beer, having Fred buy Ian a beer does not resolve the debt.  Again, this results in the net loss of a beer for Bob which is bad.  All beer debt must be paid to the person to whom it is owed.

## Beer Debt Transfer

Suppose Fred once again owes Bob a beer.  But Fred never actually sees Bob.  However, Ian frequently sees them both.  It is acceptable for Fred to buy Ian a beer with the understanding that Ian will, in the future, buy Bob a beer, thus completing the payment of the debt.  This is only allowed when all three parties are in agreement about the transfer.
